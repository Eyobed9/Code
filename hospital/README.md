#### Description:
In the country I am currently living in, there aren't many hospitals that have their own website. One day my friend and I were given an assignment. The assignment was to come up with an idea that could be helpful to the community. So, we started thinking, and this idea of building a hospital website came up. We discussed the features it would have, but we didn't have a clue how to build it. So, we just submitted the assignment as an idea. After several months, I started learning CS50, and lastly, I was given the final project. So, when I was choosing an idea for the project, this idea became the one I chose. So, I started working, and it went well. I didn't have much time because I had other responsibilities, but I just did it when I had the time. One of the challenges I faced in the project was displaying the information about physicians using an AJAX request. It took me several days to get it to work like it does now. The features of the website are:
It has a home page that displays information about the hospital.
It has a page that displays information about the physicians.
It has a page that displays information about the services provided by the hospital.
It has a page that displays information about the aims and objectives of the hospital.
It has a page that displays information about the contact details of the hospital.
It has a page that displays information about the location of the hospital.
It has a page that displays information about the Medical devices.
It has a page that displays information about the Patient rooms.
It has a page to book an appointment with a physician.
It has a page that registers a patient for a medical card.
It has a page that displays information about the patient's medical card.
It allows the patient to login to view the appointments and medical card.


Overall, I have made a simple demo hospital website that can be used by any clinic or hospital.
