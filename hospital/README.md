#### Description:
In the country I am currently living in there aren't many hospitals that have their own website. One day my friend and I were given an assignment, the assignment is to get an idea that can be helpful to the community. So, we started thinking and this idea of building a hospital website came up and we discussed the features it would have but we didn't have the clue how to build it. So, we just submitted the assignment as an idea. After several months I started learning CS50 and lastly I was given the final project. So, when I was choosing an idea for the project, this idea became the one I chose. So, I started working and it went well. I didn't have much time because I had another responsibilities, but I just did it when I got the time. One of the challenges I faced in the project was displaying the information of about physicians using an ajax request. It took me several days to get it to work like it does now. The features of the website are:
- It has a home page that displays the information about the hospital.
- It has a page that displays the information about the physicians.
- It has a page that displays the information about the services provided by the hospital.
- It has a page that displays the information about the aims and objectives of the hospital.
- It has a page that displays the information about the contact details of the hospital.
- It has a page that displays the information about the location of the hospital.
- It has a page that displays the information about the Medical devices.
- It has a page that displays the information about the Patient rooms.
- It has a page that book an appointment with a physician.
- It has a page that registers a patient for getting a medical card.
- It has a page that displays the information about the patient's medical card.
- It logins the patient to view the appointments and medical card.

 Overall, I have made a simple demo hospital website that can be used by any clinic or hospital.
