        <h6 class="text-success">At HealthHub, we understand the importance of providing comprehensive information about cancer treatment options. Here, we aim to empower you with knowledge to make informed decisions about your health. Below are some common treatment modalities used in cancer care:</h6>

    </div>   
    <h5 class="text-primary">Surgery</h5>
    <p class="">Surgery is a common treatment option for cancer. It involves removing tumors and affected tissues from the body. Different surgical techniques may be used, such as minimally invasive procedures or more extensive operations. Your healthcare team will determine the most suitable approach based on your specific case.</p>
    <h5 class="text-primary">Radiation Therapy</h5>
    <p class="list-group-item">Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. It can be delivered externally (external beam radiation) or internally (brachytherapy). Radiation therapy is often used in combination with other treatments or as a standalone option, depending on the type and stage of cancer.</p>
    <h5 class="text-primary">Chemotherapy</h5>
    <p>Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. It can be administered orally or intravenously, and it works by targeting rapidly dividing cells throughout the body. While chemotherapy can have side effects, such as hair loss and nausea, advances in medical science have led to improved therapies with reduced side effects.</p>
    <h5 class="text-primary">Immunotherapy</h5>
    <p class="list-group-item">Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment approach that harnesses the body's immune system to fight cancer. It includes therapies like checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy. Immunotherapy has shown promising results in treating certain types of cancer, such as melanoma and lung cancer.</p>
    <h5 class="text-primary">Targeted Therapy</h5>
    <p>Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to target specific genes or proteins that are involved in the growth and spread of cancer. It can be used alone or in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Targeted therapy has been shown to be effective in treating certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer and lung cancer.</p>
    <h5 class="text-primary">Hormone Therapy</h5>
    <p class="list-group-item">Hormone therapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to block the effects of hormones on cancer cells. It can be used alone or in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Hormone therapy has been shown to be effective in treating certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer.</p>
    <h5 class="text-primary">Clinical Trials</h5>
    <p>Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments or procedures to find out if they are safe and effective. They are an important part of the drug development process and can help improve patient care. If you are interested in participating in a clinical trial, talk to your doctor about the options available to you.</p>
    <h5 class="text-primary">Supportive Care</h5>
    <p class="list-group-item">Supportive care is an important part of cancer treatment. It focuses on managing side effects, pain management, nutritional support, and addressing emotional well-being. Your healthcare team will provide guidance and resources to help you navigate the challenges that may arise during your cancer journey.</p>
    <h6 class="color_1">Remember, every cancer case is unique, and treatment options may vary. It's essential to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for your specific situation.</h6>
